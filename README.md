## User Story:

We are living in the age of modern technology where people are used to having information about anything they want at their fingertips. Our app is no different and is geared towards sports fans and anyone who gets excited about the Olympics. With OwinPics!, users will be alerted each time the USA wins a medal in the 2020 Tokyo olympics. They will then be able to search any of the medalist to find out additional information about them. What may seem like a simple google search can become overwhelming with the loads of results that come up so with this app we have simplified things and allowed users to get right to the point of seeing what they want, the USA winners!
